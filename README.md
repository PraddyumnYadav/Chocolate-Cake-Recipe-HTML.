- ***Position Property***
- The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.
- static = The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. This is the default value.
- relative = The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.
- absolute = The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
- fixed = The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
- sticky = The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block .
